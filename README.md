## My Experience and learnings

When I started this project  I was  just got comfortable with basic Python and object-oriented programming. I spent a couple of hours trying to figure out how full-stack development works. I researched how to structure the app, set up routes, templates, forms, and basic logics
                         I initially tried to build the backend myself but realized I wouldn’t be able to complete it fully in time for the project i submitted. So I decided to use chatbots  to the code while focused on making sure my ideas where implemented correctly 

I handled:
App structure and routing
 UI design decisions using Bootstrap
Debugging errors during upload, display
 Deployment and fixes on Render

It took about six  hours in total, including learning, fixing errors, and deploying the project. The process wasn’t perfect, but I learned a lot from it  especially about making quick decisions, using tools wisely.This project was built in a short time, mainly to demonstrate how I approach problems, learn quickly, and get a working product out. It’s not perfect, but it reflects what I could do with limited experience
